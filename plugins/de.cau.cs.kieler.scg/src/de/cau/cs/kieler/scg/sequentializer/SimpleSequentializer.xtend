/** 
 * This class is part of the SCG transformation chain. The chain is used to gather important information 
 * about the schedulability of a given SCG. This is done in several key steps. Between two steps the results 
 * are cached in specifically designed metamodels for further processing. At the end of the transformation
 * chain a newly generated (and sequentialized) SCG is returned. <br>
 * You can either call the transformations manually or use the SCG transformation extensions to enrich the
 * SCGs with the desired information.<br>
